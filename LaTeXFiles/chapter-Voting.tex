\section{Study Guide}


To prepare for the exam over this chapter,
you should review the in-class worksheets and homework.
Be ready to do the kind of problems you faced on the homework.

As a general guide, I recommend reviewing the following topics.


\begin{enumerate}
  \item Know how to read a preference table
  \item Calculate the winner according to
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Plurality
          \item Borda count
          \item Plurality with elimination
          \item Pairwise comparison
        \end{enumerate}
  \item Devise preference tables that satisfy given conditions
        (e.g.,~``Come up with a preference table where the pairwise comparison test produces no winner.'')
  \item Weighted voting
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Know how weighted voting on yes/no motions works.
          \item Understand the notation $[q|w_1,\ldots,w_n]$.
          \item Given a weighted voting system, find any dictators, dummies, or voters with veto power.
        \end{enumerate}
  \item Construct weighted voting systems that satisfy given conditions
        (e.g.,~``Come up with a weighted voting system where two people have veto power.'')
  \item Calculate the Banzhaf Power Index for the voters in a weighted voting system.
  \item Calculate the Schaply-Shubik Power Index for the voters in a weighted voting system.
\end{enumerate}
