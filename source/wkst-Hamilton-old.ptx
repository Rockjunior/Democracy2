<introduction>
  <p>
      When you are trying to choose a best choice among a bunch of options, you will have a preference for which choices you like the best.
    We will be working on how to chose the "best" when you have multiple people with different opinions.

  <li>
    <p>
      What is the total population?

  <li>
    <p>
      How many seats are you apportioningIf you aren’t given this number, it is the total of the Standard Quotas?
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Calculate the Standard Divisor (divide your population by the number of seats):
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Calculate all the Standard Quotas (Q.) (divide the population of each state by your Standard Divisor).
      The total of your standard quotas should be the same as the number of seats.
      If that is not the case, you have rounded off too much.:

  <li>
    <p>
      Write down all the Lower Quotas (LQ) by cutting off the decimal places.
      The total of your lower quotas should be less than the number of seats.
      The difference between the two is the additional seats you get to give out.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Give out your additional seats by giving one seat to each state ranked by the stuff to the right of the decimal point on the standard quotas.
    </p>
  </li>
