    <p>
        In this chapter, we explore the mathematics behind personal finance, loans, investments, and retirement planning.
        We retain the following conventions:

          <p>A student rents a post-hole digger from RentAll to build a fence. The cost is $12.95 per day, and they keep it for three days. How much will they pay?</p>

    <p>These problems show us the basic idea behind simple interest: the amount charged is proportional to the principal (amount borrowed) and the time period.</p>

    <definition xml:id="def-simple-interest-formula">
      <statement>
        <p>The <term>simple interest formula</term> is:
