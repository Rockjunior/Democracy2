    Weighted voting systems are when there are <m>n</m> voters labeled <m>P_{1}\dots P_{n}</m>, and each voter casts a vote with a certain weight, <m>w_{i}</m>.
    Think of this as having each voter being able to cast <m>w_{i}</m> votes all for the same decision.
    In order for a motion to pass, the sum of all the votes needs to be at least <m>q</m>, the quota.
    We need the quota to be more than 50%of the sum of all the votes and no more than the sum of all the votes, but it can be anything in between.
    We give a weighted voting system as <m>[q|w_{1},w_{2},\dots,w_{n}]</m>.
